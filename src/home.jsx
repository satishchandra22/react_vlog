      text: " When was the last time you took some time out from your busy schedule and sat down on the terrace with your favourite person and gazed at the stars? Oh, wait! If you are a Delhi resident, clear skies are not what you are probably accustomed to; forget about spotting a star in the night sky! However, if we tell you there is a hidden gem located just about 100kms from Ajmer that offers not just an opportunity for you to star gaze but so much more, would it pique your interest? The prospect of visiting such a dreamy place piqued my interest too. It was not just the star-studded skies, but the idea of staying in a cottage nestled in the lap of nature that came as an interesting prospect. So, I started off early in the morning from Delhi. My destination was Raipur, Rajasthan, which is about 500 kms from the national capital. Travelling by road would have been quite a task so the most plausible option was to take the New Delhi-Ajmer Shatabdi Express. From Ajmer, it was a 2-hour-long drive to our destination.Oh wait, I didn't tell you about the location yet, did I? Well, it's Brij Lakshman Sagar, which was originally built in the late 19th century as a hunting lodge and later transformed into a boutique hotel. Away from the hustle and bustle of city life, as soon as you step into Lakshman Sagar, you will realise it’s a world of its own. It gives you the taste of a rustic life laced with luxury."
